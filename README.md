## Hackvote

Each month, Heyzap holds a hackday where team members work on any project they wish. Following the hackday, we vote on our favorite projects, and the winner receives a prize. 

Unfortunately, our previous voting site has been offline for awhile. This month, I created a new site written in Haskell using [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com).
