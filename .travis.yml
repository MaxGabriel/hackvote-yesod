# So in the version of Cabal that Travis CI runs, tests are automatically run when you install with testing enabled (see https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1647)
# Additionally, `cabal test` would fail in the script section, reporting that the version of GHC and cabal had both changed.
# Consequently I'm just relying on Cabal running tests when installing; so I setup postgres in the before_install step

before_install:
  - psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE hackvote_test;' -U postgres

install:
    - PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH
    - cabal --version
    - echo $PATH
    - cabal install cabal-install
    - source .bashrc
    - cabal --version
    - cabal update
    - cabal install alex
    - cabal install --enable-tests --max-backjumps=-1 --reorder-goals

script:
    - echo Done
